Introduction
======

The Lab targets for research in *Rehabilitation, Assembly, Intelligence, and Longevity of Structures (RAlLS)*.

The Lab belongs to the Institute of Urban Smart Transportation & Safety Maintenance, the National Key Laboratory of Green Longevity Road Engineering in Extreme Environment, and the Department of Civil and Transporation Engineering in Shenzhen University.

The Lab is led by Prof. Liu, who published over **25+** research works including journals, conference papers, and receieved **800+** citations in Google Scholar. His received Excellent Young Scholar Funding for Overseas of China, and his research work won the scholarship from International Concrete Repair Institute (ICRI).

The research interests covered by the lab includes:

**Optimization and application of machine learning algorithms on performance prediction of structures**
	
**Repair and strengthening of existing concrete structures (bridges/buildings)**
	
**Material and mechanical behavior of high/ultra-high performance concrete**
	
**Structural behavior of precast concrete members (Accelerated Bridge Construction, Modular integrated Construction)**

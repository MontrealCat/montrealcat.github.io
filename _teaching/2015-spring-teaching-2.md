Professor Tongxu Liu in the Department of Civil and Transporation Engineering in Shenzhen University (China newest famous city) is searching highly motivated and talented individuals to join his research group as Postdoctal Fellows, Ph. D Students, or Master Students. Prof. Liu`s group belongs to the National Key Laboratory of Green Longevity Road Engineering in Extreme Environment, which are all led by Academian Yanliang Du. His research covers: 

1)Optimization and application of machine learning algorithms and large-model-related techniques on performance prediction model of structures;

2)Repair and strengthening of existing concrete structures (bridges/buildings); 

3)Material and mechanical behavior of high/ultra-high performance concrete; 

4)Structural behavior of precast concrete members (ABC, MiC). 

For Postdoctal Fellows, high competitive salary of 330000 ~ 420000 CNY per year can be obtained by funding from Prof. Liu and the government. Several research fundings can also be applied from various sources. 

For Ph.D. and Master Students, the tuition fee can be completely waived and living allowance of  can be obtained (at least 5000 ~ 7000 CNY per month for Ph.D. and 1000 CNY per month for Master). Students are also supported by the Prof. Liu to apply additional student scholarship of 20000 ~ 70000 CNY per year given by the government.

Prof. Liu is currently very active in the research area, with research funding of over five million CNY in the next five years. He is dedicated to innovative research in structural engineering, aiming to promote the application of new materials and algorithms in rapid construction and repair of concrete structures. He sincerely invite young scholars with a passion in the related area to join his research team. The promotion is valid for at least 3 to 5 years, and applicants from all over the world with English communication capability are welcomed!

Interesting applicant can directly send his CV, brief research introduction and available starting time via email tongxu.liu@szu.edu.cn. Details can also be found in the following websites:

In 2024, I launched the WeChat public account "Frontiers of Structural Engineering Reference". My goal is to collaborate with teachers, students, and industry professionals to continuously follow new directions, papers, scholars, and information in the field of structural engineering. We will explore the future development of structural engineering together. Young people and scholars interested in this field are welcome to follow and communicate with me at any time. I look forward to moving forward with you!

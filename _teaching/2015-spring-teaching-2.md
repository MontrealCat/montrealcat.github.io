In 2024, I launched the WeChat public account "Frontiers of Structural Engineering Reference". My goal is to collaborate with teachers, students, and industry professionals to continuously follow new directions, papers, scholars, and information in the field of structural engineering. We will explore the future development of structural engineering together. Young people and scholars interested in this field are welcome to follow and communicate with me at any time. I look forward to moving forward with you!
